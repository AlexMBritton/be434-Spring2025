# Course Overview

Welcome to BioSystems Analytics (BE434/534)! In this course, you’ll learn how to write programs in Python through games and short coding exercises. You’re about to embark on an exciting journey to learn an important and in-demand skill set.

## Course prerequisites:
This course builds your Python skills from the ground up! No prior skills are required. Just lots of good-old fashioned practice... 

## Course objectives:
You will learn about Python through simple coding examples. This will give you an understanding of
* Basic Python syntax (if, for, while, defining functions)
* Using common Python data structures (strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries)
* Importing and using additional Python modules for testing code (pytest, flake8, mypy)
* Using data directly from files and directories
* Coding real-world examples  

## Your development environment:
To simplify your coding experience, we will use Repl.it, an online platform for writing and developing code. Repl.it has the added feature of allowing you to add a collaborator (that's me!) to help you if you get stuck. We will be able to code together simultaneously (similar to Google docs) and work through any problems you may have. Check out the setup documents for more details on getting your coding environment set up and downloading all of the course materials from GitHub. 

## How to be sucessful in the class:
Each week, we will cover one chapter in the text for the class [Tiny Python Projects](http://tinypythonprojects.com/) by Ken Youens-Clark. This text is available free of charge through the University of Arizona online catalog. Each week you will need to:

* Watch the short video lectures that provide an overview of the chapter
* Read the chapter
* Complete the practice exercises for the chapter (in "examples" in the class GitHub repository)
* Complete the quiz for the chapter (based on the exercises)
* Complete the homework assignment for the chapter (in "assignments" in the class GitHub repository)
* Use the slack discussion forum to ask questions, get help, or go deeper

In the last two weeks of the semester, you will get the opportunity to complete a final project to use all of the wonderful skills you have acquired. Projects will vary at the graduate- or undergraduate-level.

## How deadlines work:
Each week's course materials will be made available on Monday at 8 am, and all tasks must be completed by Sunday at 11:59pm. These deadlines help you organize your time, and keep you on track. Chapters build on one another, so you must complete each chapter before proceeding to the next. By working on each chapter, each week, you will get you the practice you need to learn the wonders of Python!

## Submitting homework
You'll be using Repl.it for writing and testing Python programs. At the beginning of the class, you will "fork" or copy your own version of the course materials (a GitHub repository), and work on your copy of the GitHub repository in Replit. You will also share your web-based GitHub repository with me, your instuctor, so I can help along the way and grade your assignments at the end of each week. All you need to do to share/turn-in your assignments with me, is to "push" them to your GitHub repository. See details in "setup2_github".

## Getting and giving help
Here are a few ways you can give and get help: 

Discussion forums: You can share information and ideas with your fellow students in the discussion forum on slack. Slack is also great place to find answers to questions you may have that have already been asked. If you're stuck on a concept, are struggling to solve a practice exercise, or you just want more information on a subject, the discussion forums are there to help you move forward. See details in "setup1_slack".

Online: Throughout this course, I will teach you how to code in Python, but this is a big topic! I will provide a ton of information through videos, reading, examples, and supplemental readings, but sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own (this is true throughout your career and in the real-world!). Feel free to use your favorite search engine to find more information about concepts we cover in this course — but be sure your work is your own! No AI-generated code please, although you are welcome to use the limited access to Replit AI for support on proper syntax and code suggestions. How else will you learn to code? Practice, practice, practice!

Office hours: You can always get help through the office hours. These office hours are online via Zoom (https://arizona.zoom.us/my/bonniehurwitz) on Fridays 12-1pm. Or, you are also welcome to schedule an appointment: bhurwitz@arizona.edu.
